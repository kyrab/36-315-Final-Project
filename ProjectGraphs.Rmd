# RESEARCH QUESTIONS

+ What attributes are associated with which genres?
  - Facetted histograms
  - Rap songs have more speechiness
  - Few songs have high liveness or acousticness
  - Most songs are loud
  - Valence is uniformly distributed
+ What attributes make a song popular?
  - Plot danceability vs. popularity? Separate by genre?
+ Have the attributes of songs that appear on the top 2000 list changed over time?
  - MDS plot/dendrogram to visualize similarity
  - Comparison word cloud for top genres
  - Time series plot of a particular attribute

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
######### ARTIST NAME WORDCLOUD #########
# Big name ==> more popular, can modify to replace artists with song names too

# Redefine as Corpus
artists = Corpus(VectorSource(spotify$Artist))

# Remove punctuations
artists = tm_map(artists, removePunctuation)

dtm.artists = DocumentTermMatrix(artists, control = list(stopwords = TRUE))

######### MDS PLOT #########

# Just include qualitative variables for MDS
spotify.subset = spotify %>% 
  select(-c(Index, Title, Artist, Top.Genre, Genre, Decade, Range))

spotify.scaled = apply(spotify.subset, MARGIN = 2, FUN = function(x) x/sd(x))
spotify.scaled.dist = dist(spotify.scaled)

mds = cmdscale(d = spotify.scaled.dist, k = 2)
spotify$mds1 = mds[,1]
spotify$mds2 = mds[,2]
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = spotify, aes(x = mds1, y = mds2)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Range), size = 0.75) +
  labs(x = "MDS Coordinate 1", y = "MDS Coordinate 2",
       title = "MDS Coordinate 2 vs. MDS Coordinate 1")
```

Interpretation: songs from 1990s-2010s have similar qualitative characteristics, and so do songs from 1950s-1980s, since we can see how blue dots are mostly concentrated on the bottom and red dots are mostly concentrated on the top.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
######### COMPARISON WORD CLOUD #########
# Decade range subsets:
early.songs = subset(spotify, Range == "1950s-1980s")
current.songs = subset(spotify, Range == "1990s-2010s")

# Redefine as Corpus (replace "title" with "genre" oops)
title.early = Corpus(VectorSource(early.songs$Top.Genre))
title.current = Corpus(VectorSource(current.songs$Top.Genre))

# Songs from 1950-1980s:
title.early = tm_map(title.early, content_transformer(tolower))
title.early = tm_map(title.early, removePunctuation)
title.early = tm_map(title.early, stripWhitespace)

# Songs from 1990s-2010s:
title.current = tm_map(title.current, content_transformer(tolower))
title.current = tm_map(title.current, removePunctuation)
title.current = tm_map(title.current, stripWhitespace)

# Combine:
titleAll = tm:::c.VCorpus(title.early, title.current)
titleAll = tm_map(titleAll, PlainTextDocument)

# Remove stop words, perform stemming:
titleAll = tm_map(titleAll, removeWords, stopwords("english"))
titleAll = tm_map(titleAll, stemDocument)

# Term-Document matrix:
tdm.titleAll = TermDocumentMatrix(titleAll, control = list(weighting = weightTfIdf))

# Convert to a matrix class:
tdm.titleAll = as.matrix(tdm.titleAll)

# Comparison calculations:
ne = nrow(early.songs)
nc = nrow(current.songs)

tdm.early.sum = rowSums(tdm.titleAll[, 1:ne])
tdm.current.sum = rowSums(tdm.titleAll[, (ne + 1):(ne + nc)])
tdm.titleAll.sum = cbind(tdm.early.sum, tdm.current.sum)
colnames(tdm.titleAll.sum) = c("1950s-1980s", "1990s-2010s")
```

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
set.seed(0)

comparison.cloud(tdm.titleAll.sum, random.order = FALSE, rot.per = 0.3,
                 colors = c("blue", "green"), max.words = 200)
```

Interpretation: there are a few song genres that almost exclusively appear in the 1950s-1980s, such as "adult standards," "classic rock," "album," and "eurpop." Meanwhile, "alternative," "dutch," "modern," and "pop" music seem to be more popular genres in the era 1990s-2010s. Some genres such as "jazz" are more common in the 1990s-2010s but since it is small, it also appears in the 1950s-1980s a lot.

```{r}
######### MULTICOLORED DENSITY CURVE #########

findRange2 = function(x) {
  ifelse(x == "1950s-60s" || x == "1970s", "1950s-70s",
    ifelse(x == "1980s" || x == "1990s", "1980s-90s", "2000s-10s"))
}

spotify$Range2 = sapply(spotify$Decade, FUN = findRange2)
```

```{r}
# Also good: Popularity, Valence w/ Range. Mediocre: Energy, Loudness.
# Bad: Liveness, Acousticness, Speechiness, Danceability

ggplot(data = spotify, aes(x = Duration, color = Decade)) +
  geom_density(size = 1.25) +
  labs(color = "Range")
```

Interpretation: song duration has changed throughout the decades. All are right skewed but 1950s-1960s seemed to have the smallest duration mode, followed by 1970s, 2010s, 2000s, 1980s, and then 1990s. Seemed to have cycled around.

```{r}
######### TIME SERIES #########
average = spotify %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  summarize(avg = median(Danceability))
```

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Also good: Loudness, Energy, Popularity

ggplot(data = average, aes(x = Year, y = avg)) +
  geom_line(color = "red") +
  stat_rollapplyr(width = 10, align = "right", size = 2, alpha = .4) + 
  labs(title = "Median Danceability vs. Year",
       subtitle = "Width = 10",
       x = "Year", y = "Median Danceability")
```

Interpretation: median danceability comes in waves. From the 1950s-1970s, it was pretty low, but increased from 1980s-1990s, before decreasing again before 2000, and increasing since then.
