For this project, I mainly worked on writing the data description and exploring the third research question. I made all four types of graphs that can be seen in our report that address that question, and wrote their accompanying analyses. In the conclusion, I wrote the part that addressed the third research question, the paragraph regarding limitations to our analyses, and the paragraph on future work. I also spent time helping my groupmates brainstorm graph ideas for their research questions, added in the statistical tests that appear in the analysis of the boxplot graph, fixed bugs (and subsequently adjusted the analyses) in the dendrogram and artist name word clouds, reformatted the tables and plot legends so that nothing overlapped, and handled final review, revisions, and hand-in.
