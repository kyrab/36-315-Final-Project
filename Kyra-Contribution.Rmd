For this project, I mainly worked on writing the data description and exploring the third research question. With respect to the latter, I made all four types of graphs that can be seen in our report and wrote their accompanying analyses. Finally, in the conclusion, I wrote the part that addressed the third research question, the paragraph regarding limitations to our analyses, and the paragraph on future work. I also spent time helping my groupmates brainstorm graph ideas for their research questions, added in the statistical tests that appear in the analysis of the boxplot graph, fixed a bug (and subsequently adjusting the analysis) in the dendrogram and artist name word clouds, and was in charge of final revisions and hand-in.
